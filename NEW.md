# New phone

If you just bought your new phone, here are things you might need to do.

## Unlock bootloader

You'll most probably need to
[unlock the bootloader](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=721838&st=14360#entry63359408)
to install custom ROM and recovery.

* Use sim-card instead of Wi-Fi
* Activate menu for developers -> status mi unlock -> login
* ...
* ... waiting ...
* ...
* Launch MiFlashUnlock -> login -> phone into fastboot mode (voldown+power until
vibration) -> unlock. You'll probably need drivers if your phone can't be seen
in fastboot mode.

## Backup IMEI, initial ROM, etc.
